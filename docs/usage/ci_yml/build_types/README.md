# Built-In Build Types

The default Build Type for new jobs is controlled through the "Configure
Jenkins" screen. In addition you can override the setting for a specific
job on its configuration page to use a different Build Type. The build
types are:

* [docker_compose](DockerCompose.md)
* [install_packages](InstallPackages.md)
