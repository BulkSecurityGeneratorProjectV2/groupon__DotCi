# `.ci.yml`

This file controls the configuration of the CI build so that it is
driven from the repo. It is governed by its "Build Type", which controls
the specification for the file:

* [Build Types](build_types/README.md)

Most build types (especially the built-in ones) have common
configuration that can be applied:

* [Plugins](Plugins.md)
* [Notifications](Notifications.md)
